## Script Introduction

This script blocks all YouTube ads, including YouTube Music, YouTube Kids, and YouTube Shorts. It's seamless, with no white space, no flashing, and prioritizes user experience. It's currently the best YouTube ad-blocking script available. Please give it a good review; we've met by chance. Don't recommend it widely, it's not worth the effort. Its main function is seamless, comprehensive ad blocking; its secondary function is providing some useful features. It should be one of the best YouTube ad-blocking scripts available. It's continuously being updated. If you find it useful, please give it a good review. Thank you for your support. If you encounter any problems with the script, please check the error information and problem feedback below and send me the relevant information.

***If ads appear while playing videos, please first confirm that the problem is with the script and reply as instructed; otherwise, there will be no response.***

### Important Reminder
Please do not use any other ad-blocking scripts or plugins to block YouTube logs, ads, or other network requests. This can easily lead to your account being blacklisted. A blacklisted account will result in YouTube giving you special treatment regarding ads on your computer. This will manifest as some videos failing to play; disabling the script, logging out of the account, or using a different account will allow normal playback. Other account functions will not be affected. At this point, you have the following options:
- Modify the value of the disableRemovePlayerAd variable near line 55 of the script to true, so as not to block the ad at the beginning of the video, while keeping other functions normal.
- Switching your IP address when accessing YouTube can sometimes restore your account's credit limit. The sign of this restoration is that you can now play all videos normally.
- Log out of account
- Change account usage
- Wait for the script to switch to blacklist mode...

### How to use options of this script
Only three options are there in script, which're enough in my prespective. You can use them by typing in Search bar of YouTube :
- **2333** - Opens a dialog box with some options. Just make your preference.
- **2444** - Opens a dialog with information of your preference.
- **2555** - It'll allow you to reset all your configurations in one click.
